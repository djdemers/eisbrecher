My friend has a really nice BMW and we went for a beautiful drive downtown. 
We could smell fresh brot as we were driving. 
I went to the Baeckerei and ordered a chocolate cake for my friends birthday.
I could feel the sun beaming on my lederhose. 
We stopped in Berlin to watch a Bayern Munich game.
There is a sweet little Hund playing in an alleyway.
We said hi to the hund and fed it some bratwurst. 
I bought tickets to travel to Ireland but never made it to the Flughafen
After that I decided to spend my evening in the beirgarten.
My friend called me to tell me that he tried to race a Porche in his BMW on the Autobahn but he lost.
He said the owner of Porsche had the last name Mehlhase.
'Mehlhase? I love mehlhase!' I replied, 'particularly with a nice apfelkuchen.'
I met them at a rammstein concert in April.
